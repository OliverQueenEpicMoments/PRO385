RadioGuy: This is high command what is your status?
Phantom-6 (Injured): This is Phantom-6, I'm in some sort of mansion but I don't remember how.
RadioGuy: Solid copy, are you able to continue as planned?
- Yeah I can procede as planned.
	RadioGuy: Very well, you are already in the target location. Locate Alpha Target and call for exfil when it's secured.
- Where is everyone?
	RadioGuy: After the crash most vital signs went down, assume your squad is dead and resume their mission. Alpha target should be within close proximity, call for exfil when it is secured.
