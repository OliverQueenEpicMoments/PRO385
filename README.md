## Game Overview

In **Eclipse Protocol: Prelude to Insanity**, you start in a dimly lit mansion, where most doors are locked and an eerie silence pervades. After a sudden power failure, the house is plunged into darkness, unleashing terrifying creatures. Fleeing into the surrounding forest, you make your way to an abandoned gas station, where you find a key. Returning to the now fully unlocked mansion, you prepare to face the horrors within.
The game challenges you to manage your sanity as you navigate through increasingly hostile environments. With multiple endings and a deep, branching narrative, your choices will determine the fate of not just yourself, but the world around you.

In **Eclipse Protocol**, you play as a test subject who wakes up in the underground lab of the Hades Site, with no memory of how you got there. The lab is dark, most doors are locked, and a sense of dread hangs in the air. As you explore, you uncover secrets about the facility, your own identity, and all the other terrifying entities locked up down there with you.

## Key Features

- **Sanity Mechanic:** The closer you get to enemies, the more your sanity erodes. This affects both gameplay and narrative, leading to different endings based on your mental state.

- **Enemy Encounters:** Face off against horrifying enemies, each with unique behaviors and death sequences inspired by the SCP series.

## Game Mechanics

### Sanity Mechanic
Your sanity decreases as you approach enemies or encounter disturbing events. High insanity levels unlock unique narrative paths and gameplay elements, such as accessing the red door for the insanity ending.

### Enemy Spawning
Enemies are spawned using an array of spawn points. The system ensures that enemies don't spawn too close to the player, balancing challenge with fairness.

### NPC Interactions

- **The AI:** Located in the expanded forest area, the AI has its own mysterious agenda that you can choose to assist with.
- **Vampire Merchant:** A unique NPC who offers you items in exchange for blood or other resources.

### Endings
- **Escape Ending:** Successfully escape the Hades Site by locating and fixing gate controls.
- **AI Ending:** Assist the AI by fixing generators and servers, leading to a unique conclusion.
- **Insanity Ending:** Fully embrace your madness and uncover the truth behind the red door in a maze-like sequence.

## Storyline

The story begins with the **Prologue**, where the player explores a large house with locked doors and hidden dangers. After a power failure, the house is overrun with creepy crawlies, forcing the player to venture into the woods and a gas station to retrieve a key. Upon returning, they find the house fully unlocked, leading to further exploration and the discovery of the **Mind's Bane**.

The main game takes place at the **Hades Site** lab. The player must restore power, explore the woods, and gather items necessary for their escape. Depending on their actions and sanity level, they may choose different narrative paths, leading to one of several endings.

As of now, only the prologue is playable but not finished yet.
