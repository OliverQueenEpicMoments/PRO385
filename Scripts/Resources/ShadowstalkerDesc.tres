EnemyName = "Shadowstalkers"
CauseOfDeath = "Radiation Poisoning"
EnemyDescription = "The victim was discovered in a crouched position, exhibiting complete cessation of life functions. A significant amount of emesis was present at the scene, later confirmed to be consistent with acute radiation syndrome. Autopsy results revealed extensive internal damage consistent with severe radiation exposure."
ExtraDescription = "Given that Subject Apophis remains securely contained within Hades Site, current hypotheses suggest that Subject Shadowstalker, a recently secured entity, was responsible for the fatality. It appears the victim inadvertently provoked the entity by exposing it to prolonged light, a known trigger for its aggressive behavior. The resulting exposure to the entityâ€™s radiative emissions led to rapid onset of terminal radiation poisoning. Further research is required to understand the full extent of Subject Shadowstalker's capabilities and the precise nature of its photophobia."
